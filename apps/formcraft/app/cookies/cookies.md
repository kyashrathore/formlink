It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

This policy is designed to comply with privacy regulations in both the United States (including the California Consumer Privacy Act/California Privacy Rights Act - CCPA/CPRA) and the European Union (General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive).

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Formlink.ai) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

### Why do we use cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website and forms to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Website and to understand the usage of our services. We also use cookies for analytics and marketing purposes.

### What types of cookies do we use?

The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Website and their purposes are described below:

**1. Strictly Necessary Cookies:** These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Website and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our Website functions.

**2. Performance and Functionality Cookies:** These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality (like remembering your login details) may become unavailable.

**3. Analytics and Customization Cookies:** These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website for you.

**4. Advertising (Targeting) Cookies:** These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers, and in some cases, selecting advertisements that are based on your interests.

**5. Cookies on Forms Created by Our Users:** Please note that when you fill out a form created by a Formlink.ai user, that form may also place cookies on your device. These cookies are governed by the privacy practices of the form creator, and we encourage you to review their specific cookie policies. Formlink.ai is not responsible for the privacy practices of its users.

### How can you control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences in the following ways:

- **Cookie Consent Banner:** When you first visit our Website, you will be presented with a cookie consent banner. This banner allows you to accept all cookies, reject all non-essential cookies, or customize your cookie preferences. Your preferences will be saved for future visits.
- **Browser Controls:** You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.

### Your Rights in the EU and California

**For users in the European Union (under GDPR):**

You have the right to be informed about the use of cookies, to give your explicit and granular consent before non-essential cookies are placed on your device, and to withdraw your consent at any time as easily as you gave it. Our cookie consent banner is designed to facilitate these rights.

**For users in California (under CCPA/CPRA):**

You have the right to opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. Some data collected by advertising cookies may be considered a "sale" or "sharing" under California law. To exercise this right, please use our cookie consent banner to disable advertising cookies or visit our "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" link on our homepage.

### Changes to this Cookie Policy

We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
