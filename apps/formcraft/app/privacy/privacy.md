We plan to offer subscription services. If you subscribe, we will use a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe) to handle your payment. We will not store your full payment card details.

All payment data is handled and stored by our chosen payment processor. You may find their privacy notice link(s) on their website (e.g., Stripe: [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)).

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

**Information automatically collected**

**(For EU, UK, and Canada residents, specific legal bases are outlined in the "WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?" section.)**

### **4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

- **Service Providers:** We share your information with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ('Service Providers') who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. The categories of Service Providers we may share personal information with are as follows:
  - **Cloud Computing Services & Hosting:** Vercel
  - **Data Storage & Authentication Services:** Supabase
  - **Artificial Intelligence Processing:** OpenRouter (and its underlying LLM providers)
  - **Payment Processors (Planned):** Stripe or similar providers
  - **Communication & Collaboration Tools**
  - **Analytics Services**
    We have contracts in place with our Service Providers, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.
- **Business Transfers:** We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
- **Legal Obligations and Rights:** We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements). We may also disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
- **With Your Consent:** We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your consent.
- **User-Directed Sharing (e.g., Google Sheets Integration):** If you instruct us to share your data with a third-party service like Google Sheets, we will do so on your behalf. You are responsible for managing your account and data with such third-party services.

We do **not** sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes.

### **5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?**

We do not directly set many cookies ourselves. However, our Services integrate with third-party services like Supabase (for authentication) and potentially others (analytics, etc.) that may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to collect or store information.

- **Essential Cookies:** Supabase uses cookies that are essential for providing authentication services (e.g., keeping you logged in). These are necessary for the Services to function.
- **Analytics and Other Cookies:** We may in the future use analytics services that use cookies to help us understand how our Services are used.

Because essential cookies are used by our core service providers (like Supabase for login), we may not display a separate cookie banner for these. However, we are reviewing our cookie practices to ensure full compliance with all applicable regulations, including the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive. For detailed information about the cookies used by our third-party providers, please refer to their respective privacy and cookie policies (e.g., Supabase, Google).

You can typically control cookies through your browser settings. However, disabling essential cookies may affect the functionality of our Services.

### **6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?**

Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your Google account (Google OAuth). If you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from Google, including your email address, display name, and profile picture. We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by Google. We recommend that you review Google's privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

### **7. HOW DO WE USE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?**

Formfiller AI utilizes artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs) via our AI Service Provider, OpenRouter, to help you create forms. When you provide input (e.g., describing the form you want to create), this input is sent to OpenRouter for processing to generate the form structure and content.

- **Data Shared with AI Providers:** Your input prompts are shared with OpenRouter and its underlying LLM providers.
- **User Responsibility:** **IMPORTANT:** Do not include any sensitive personal information, confidential information, or any data you would not want shared with third-party AI providers in your AI prompts. While we and our AI providers have security measures, the nature of AI processing means your input data will be processed by these external services. We provide warnings within the application where AI processing occurs.
- **Purpose:** This processing is solely to enable the AI-powered form creation features of our Services.

### **8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).

Generally, this means we keep your personal information (account details, forms you've created) for as long as you maintain an account with us.

**Account Deletion:** If you choose to delete your account, we will delete all your personal data associated with your account from our active systems immediately. Please note that some data may remain in our backups for a limited period as per our backup schedules, after which it will also be deleted. Data processed by our AI service providers may be subject to their retention policies.

Data collected by forms you create is your responsibility. If a respondent requests deletion of their data from a form you created, you are responsible for handling that request.

### **9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

We have implemented and rely on the technical and organizational security measures of our reputable Service Providers (Supabase, Vercel, OpenRouter, Stripe) designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures include data encryption, access controls, and secure infrastructure.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

### **10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?**

We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@formlink.ai.

Users creating forms are responsible for complying with applicable laws regarding collecting data from minors, such as obtaining verifiable parental consent.

### **11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

In some regions (like the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, and India), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

- **Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below or updating your preferences. However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
- **Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
- **Account Information:** If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can log in to your account settings and update your user account or contact us using the information provided. Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases immediately.

If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.
If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
If you are located in Canada, you may contact the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
Residents of India have rights under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, including the right to access, correct, complete, update, and erase their personal data, and the right to grievance redressal.

### **12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.

### **13. DATA CONTROLLER AND DATA PROCESSOR**

This section clarifies our roles concerning your data:

- **Formfiller AI as Data Controller:** For the personal information of our registered users (e.g., your account information like email, display name, forms you create), Formfiller AI is the Data Controller. We determine the purposes and means of processing this data.
- **Formfiller AI as Data Processor:** When you use Formfiller AI to create forms and collect responses from individuals ('Respondents'), you are the Data Controller for the personal information collected through those forms. In this scenario, Formfiller AI acts as a Data Processor on your behalf. You are responsible for ensuring that your collection and use of Respondents' data comply with all applicable privacy laws, including providing necessary notices and obtaining consents. Our processing of such data will be governed by our Terms of Service and any applicable Data Processing Addendum.

### **14. SUBSCRIPTION AND BILLING**

We plan to offer paid subscription plans for Formfiller AI.

- **Free Trial:** We may offer a 7-day free trial for our subscription plans.

Details regarding subscription terms, fees, and cancellation will be provided at the time of subscription and in our Terms of Service.

### **15. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**

Yes, we will update this Privacy Notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws and to reflect any changes in our Services or data processing practices. The updated version will be indicated by an updated 'Last updated' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification.
